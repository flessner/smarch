  <blockquote>
    Building a better tomorrow by building better tools today.

  <p class="pt-8">
    smarch is a community of developers and designers who are passionate about
    the web3 ecosystem. We believe that the web3 ecosystem is the future of the
    web and we want to make it a reality.
    <br /><br />
    The web3 ecosystem is a huge opportunity for developers to build more open, efficient
    and beautiful tools.
    <br /><br />
    However, the gas prices are high, the security is low, the scalability is low,
    the interoperability is low, and the ecosystem is still in its infancy. We are
    hoping to make a mark on the web3 ecosystem by building better tools today.
